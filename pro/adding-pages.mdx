## File-Based Routing

BunShip Pro uses TanStack Start's file-based router. Each file in `apps/web/src/routes/` becomes a route. The file path determines the URL.

## Adding a New Page

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the route file">
    Add a new `.tsx` file in the routes directory. The filename determines the URL path.

    For example, a file for a "reports" page inside the app layout would go in the appropriate nested directory under `routes/`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use the app layout">
    Protected pages use the app layout, which provides the sidebar, header, and breadcrumbs. Your page component renders inside the main content area.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fetch data from the API">
    Use the Eden client to call your API endpoints. The client is fully typed — autocomplete shows you every available endpoint, and TypeScript catches mismatches at build time.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add navigation">
    Add a link to your new page in the sidebar navigation config.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Page Patterns

Every page in BunShip Pro follows the same pattern:

1. **Data loading** — fetch what the page needs via Eden
2. **Loading state** — show a skeleton while data loads
3. **Error state** — show an error boundary if the request fails
4. **Empty state** — show a helpful message if there's no data yet
5. **Populated state** — render the actual content

Following this pattern keeps the UX consistent as you add pages.

## Tips

- **Protected vs public routes**: Auth pages (login, register) are public. Everything inside the app layout requires authentication. The router handles redirects automatically.
- **Organization context**: Pages under the org section have access to the current organization ID from the URL. The API scopes data to that org automatically.
- **Breadcrumbs**: Update automatically based on the route path. No manual config needed.
- **Page titles**: Set via the route's metadata. Shows in the browser tab and breadcrumbs.
