## How Theming Works

BunShip Pro uses CSS variables for theming, managed through Tailwind CSS. Every color in the UI references a variable, so changing one value updates the entire app.

The theme toggle switches between light and dark mode by updating a class on the root element. All components respect this automatically.

## Changing Colors

Your brand colors are defined in a single CSS file. Update the variables and every button, card, badge, and link updates to match.

The primary color is used for:
- Buttons and links
- Active states and focus rings
- Badges and status indicators
- Sidebar active items

The destructive color is used for delete buttons, error states, and warning dialogs.

## Changing Fonts

The font stack is configured in one place. BunShip Pro ships with Inter for the UI. To swap it:

1. Add your font (Google Fonts, local files, or a font service)
2. Update the font family variable
3. Adjust font weights if needed

## Dark and Light Mode

The theme toggle component is in the app header. It:

- Persists the user's preference to `localStorage`
- Respects the system preference on first visit
- Applies instantly with no flash of wrong theme

Both themes are designed together — dark mode is not an afterthought. Every component, every page, every state has been checked in both modes.

## What You Can Customize

| Element | Where |
| ------- | ----- |
| Brand colors | CSS variables file |
| Font family and sizes | CSS variables file |
| Border radius (rounded vs sharp) | CSS variables file |
| Sidebar width | Layout component |
| Logo | Public assets directory |

The theme system uses the same approach as shadcn/ui, so any shadcn theming guide applies.
