## What is BunShip Pro?

BunShip Pro is a **fullstack superset** of the free BunShip API boilerplate. It adds a complete, production-ready frontend built with TanStack Start, React, and shadcn/ui — connected to the backend via Eden for end-to-end type safety.

One monorepo. One `bun dev` command. Backend on `:3000`, frontend on `:3001`.

## What's Included

The Pro monorepo includes everything from the free version plus:

- **`apps/web/`** — TanStack Start + React frontend with file-based routing
- **`packages/ui/`** — shadcn/ui component library (Button, Card, Dialog, Table, and more)

The API code is identical to the free version. Pro adds the frontend alongside it.
