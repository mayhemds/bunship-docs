description: "Deploy BunShip Pro to production"
---

## Overview

BunShip Pro is a monorepo with two deployable apps:

| App | Port | What It Is |
| --- | ---- | ---------- |
| `apps/api` | 3000 | Elysia REST API |
| `apps/web` | 3001 | TanStack Start frontend |

You can deploy them together on one server or separately. The frontend calls the API via environment variables, so they don't need to be co-located.

## Environment Variables

The frontend needs one key variable:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
```

The API environment variables are the same as the [free version](/deployment/overview).

## Vercel

The simplest deployment option for the frontend.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your repo">
    Connect the `bunship-pro` repository to Vercel.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the frontend">
    - **Root directory**: `apps/web`
    - **Build command**: `bun run build`
    - **Output directory**: `.output`
    - Set `VITE_API_URL` in environment variables
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy the API separately">
    The API can run on any platform that supports Bun or Docker: Railway, Fly.io, a VPS, or a container service. See the [API deployment guides](/deployment/overview).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Docker

A `Dockerfile` is included for the API. For the frontend, you can build a static export or run it as a Node.js server.

```bash
# Build the API image
docker build -t bunship-api .

# Run it
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env bunship-api
```

For the frontend, build locally and deploy the output to any static hosting (Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, Netlify), or run it with Node.js.

## Domain Setup

A typical production setup:

| Domain | Points To |
| ------ | --------- |
| `app.yourdomain.com` | Frontend (Vercel or static host) |
| `api.yourdomain.com` | API (Railway, Fly.io, Docker, VPS) |

Set `VITE_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com` on the frontend and `APP_URL=https://app.yourdomain.com` on the API so redirects and CORS work correctly.

## CORS

The API is pre-configured to accept requests from the frontend origin. Update the CORS allowed origins in your `.env` when you deploy to production:

```bash
CORS_ORIGINS=https://app.yourdomain.com
```
